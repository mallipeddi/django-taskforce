TODO

    * Support for (min, max) thread-pool sizes. thread-pool needs to grow dynamically depending on the load.
    * Support for periodic tasks.
    * Swap web.py's CherryPy server for a custom, libevent-based server.
    * Test suite!
    * Support for non-JSON serializable argument & result types. 
    * Processes instead of threads?
