django-taskforce

django-taskforce implements a job server for Django apps. It lets you execute long-running tasks asynchronously in a separate process. Since a Django application blocks while serving a request it is best to move long-running tasks off into a background process that is divorced from http request/response cycle.

Though these are very early days for django-taskforce, it is heavily inspired by backgroundRb (http://backgroundrb.rubyforge.org/index.html) and will eventually support everything backgroundrb does.

DEPENDENCIES

    * Swap web.py's CherryPy server for a custom, libevent-based server.
    * Test suite!
    * Support for non-JSON serializable argument & result types.
